I'm András Ármin Szabó, a 19-year-old computer engineering student at the University of Debrecen. I am passionate about software design and development and I am proud to say that I have been programming for 6 years. My skills range widely, with a particular focus on C#, Flutter, Golang and Python. My responsibilities include server, mobile and desktop application development and I'm always interested in the latest technology trends.

I started my IT career at the Mechwart András Mechanical Engineering and Information Technology Technical College in Debrecen, where I graduated and obtained a degree in IT Systems Management. I passed the Cisco exams at CCNA 1,2,3,4 level. I have experience with databases and know how to operate and configure both Linux and Windows servers.

My English language skills are at B2 level and I speak basic Spanish. I have a category B driving licence, which allows me mobility and flexibility in my work.

One of my passions is racing simulators, which helps me relax and challenges my mind. I'm also proud of my excellent competition results, such as my 3rd place in the programming category at the 2024 WorldSkills Nationals. In addition, I have been working for 2 years in different companies where I put what I have learned into practice.

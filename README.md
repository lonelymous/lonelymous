  One of my passions is racing simulators, which helps me relax and challenges my mind. I'm also proud of my excellent competition results, such as my 3rd place in the programming category at the 2024 WorldSkills Nationals. In addition, I have been working for 2 years in different companies where I put what I have learned into practice.
